Final Project for Big Data Analysis 2022

*Research Project by Sebastian Warma and Arastu Sharma*
## Age-Related Correlates of Blood/CSF Markers in Alzheimer's Disease and Dimentia
Through the attached datasets we hope to evaluate the following research question: 
**Can we develop a model to predict incidence of dementia or alzheimers given a panel of inflammatory biomarkers and alzheimers related protein pathlogy measurement.**

### Datasets
| Dataset | Available | Size | Format | Participants | Description |
| - | -- | ------------ | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| Aging Dementia & TBI Study | Y | 150kB | csv | 108 | 29 blood and CSF markers plus demographic and clinical diagnosis data |
| Harvard Aging Brain Study | N | NA | csv | 290 | A combination of imaging and subjective questionnaire data which complements the objective biomarkers in the above dataset.|


*Currently we have access to clinical data from the Aging Dementia and TBI Study. However, we have requested access from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, and we hope to combine these two data sets.*
