# Big-Data-Analysis-Final-Project
Final Project for Big Data Analysis 2022  
*Research Project by Sebastian Warma and Arastu Sharma*
## Modelling Dementia & Alzheimer's Inidence based on Age-Related Correlates in the  Blood and CSF
Through the attached datasets we hope to evaluate the following research question: 
**Can we develop a model to predict the incidence of dementia or Alzheimers given a panel of neuroinflammatory biomarkers and Alzheimerâ€™s related protein pathology measurement?**



### Datasets
| Dataset | Available | Size | Format | Participants | Description |
| - | -- | ------------ | ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| Aging Dementia & TBI Study | Y | 150kB | csv | 108 | 29 blood and CSF markers plus demographic and clinical diagnosis data |
| Harvard Aging Brain Study | N | NA | csv | 290 | A combination of imaging and subjective questionnaire data which complements the objective biomarkers in the above dataset.|


*Currently we have access to clinical data from the Aging Dementia and TBI Study. However, we have requested access from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, and we hope to combine these two data sets.*
